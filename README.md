# Poster Based Movie Recommendation System
Choosing the best movie predict system is a necessary step for boosting user 
experience and interest in current streaming service platforms. But all these existing 
methods such as collaborative filtering have its own weakness like cold-start issues, 
issues of scalability and the propensity of these methods to generate popular items. 
Based on this, our study would try to take on this challenge by introducing a hybrid 
recommendation algorithm that employs the advantages of different recommendation 
methods. By doing so, we intend to improve recommendation accuracy, user 
satisfaction, and overall platform performance. In response to the limitations of 
existing movie recommendation systems, our study proposes a novel hybrid 
recommendation system named "Alternating Least Square - Convolutional Neural 
Network Recommendation" (ACR). ACR integrates the ALS matrix factorization 
technique with the power of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically 
utilizing VGG16, for image feature extraction. The anatomy of ACR involves 
incorporation of additional elements into the ALS matrix factorization model by 
emphasizing the effect of convolutional neural networks and specifically the VGG16 
architecture for feature extraction. In developing our methodology, we have utilized 
the strengths of collaborative filtering as well as content analysis to improve 
recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction and the performance of the platform. 
With this, our RMSE was computed at **0. 8315** by using ACR.
